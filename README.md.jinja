# {{ project_name }}

{{ project_description }}

This is a template project for building FastAPI applications using a clean, scalable, and interface-driven 3-tier architecture.

## How to Use This Template

To create a new project based on this template, you need to have `copier` installed.

```bash
pip install copier
```

Then, run the `copier copy` command, pointing to this template's repository:

```bash
copier copy gh:your-github-username/your-repo-name path/to/your-new-project
```

Copier will ask you a series of questions and generate a new project in the specified directory.

## Getting Started (for the Generated Project)

Once you have generated your project, you can follow these steps to get started:

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to your new project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your-new-project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    The project uses `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies. To install all dependencies, including development tools like `pytest`, run:
    ```bash
    pip install '.[dev]'
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the web server, use `uvicorn`:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --app-dir {{ package_name }}
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```

## Core Concepts

- **Interface-Driven Design**: Both the Service and Repository layers are defined by interfaces (Abstract Base Classes). This allows for implementations to be easily swapped out.
- **Dependency Injection**: The project heavily utilizes FastAPI's `Depends` system to manage dependencies.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
  - **API Layer** (`{{ package_name }}/api`): Handles HTTP routing and request/response handling.
  - **Service Layer** (`{{ package_name }}/service`): Contains the core business logic.
  - **Repository Layer** (`{{ package_name }}/repository`): Manages data access.
